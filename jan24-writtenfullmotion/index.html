<h1>DeadPool</h1>
<p>Deadpool (real name Wade Winston Wilson) is a fictional antihero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by artist/writer Rob Liefeld and writer Fabian Nicieza, the character first appeared in The New Mutants #98 (cover-dated February 1991). Initially Deadpool was depicted as a supervillain when he made his first appearance in The New Mutants and later in issues of X-Force, but later evolved into his more recognizable antiheroic persona. Deadpool is a disfigured and mentally unstable mercenary with the superhuman ability of an accelerated healing factor and physical prowess. He is known as the "Merc with a Mouth" because of his talkative nature and tendency to break the fourth wall, which is used by writers for humorous effect and running gags.

The character's popularity has seen him feature in numerous other media. In the 2004 series Cable and Deadpool, he refers to his own scarred appearance as "Ryan Reynolds crossed with a Shar Pei",[6][7] leading to Reynolds eventually portraying the character in the 2009 film X-Men Origins: Wolverine and reprising the role in the 2016 film Deadpool.</p>
